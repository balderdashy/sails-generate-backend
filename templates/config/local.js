/**
 * Local environment settings
 *
 * Use this file to specify configuration settings for use while developing
 * the app on your personal system: for example, this would be a good place
 * to store database or email passwords that apply only to you, and shouldn't
 * be shared with others in your organization.
 *
 * These settings take precedence over all other files in `config/`, including
 * those in the env/ subfolder.
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE:
 *    By default, `config/local.js` is included in your .gitignore, so if you're
 *    using git as a version control solution for your Sails app, keep in mind that
 *    this file won't be committed to your repository!
 *
 *    Good news is, that means you can specify configuration for your local
 *    machine in this file without inadvertently committing personal information
 *    (like database passwords) to the repo.  Plus, this prevents other members
 *    of your team from commiting their local configuration changes on top of yours.
 *
 *    In a production environment, you'll probably want to leave this file out
 *    entirely and configure all of your production overrides using `env/production.js`,
 *    or environment variables, or a combination of both.
 *
 *
 * For more information, check out:
 * http://sailsjs.org/documentation/concepts/configuration/the-local-js-file
 *
 * For a reference of misc. top-level settings not covered by other config files, see:
 * http://sailsjs.org/documentation/reference/configuration/sails-config

   * SSL/TLS (transport-layer security) is critical for preventing potential *
   * man-in-the-middle attacks.  Without a protocol like SSL/TLS, web basics *
   * like securely transmitting login credentials and credit card numbers    *
   * would be much more complicated and troublesome.                         *
   *                                                                         *
   * SSL/TLS is not only important for HTTP requests (`https://`); it's also *
   * necessary for WebSockets (over `wss://`).  Fortunately, you only need   *
   * to worry configuring SSL settings in once place: `sails.config.ssl`     *
   *                                                                         *
   * This is only relevant if you want your Sails server to manage SSL.      *
   * As your app gains traffic, you will probably want to scale to multiple  *
   * servers, and set up a load balancer.  Most of the time, you will end up *
   * terminating SSL at your load balancer for performance/simplicity.       *
   * In that case, since SSL/TLS will have already been dealt with before    *
   * packets reach your Sails app, you won't need to use this setting.       *
   * (For example, if you're terminating SSL/TLS at your load balancer, or   *
   * This is also true if you're using a PaaS or other host with a built-in  *
   * load balancer (e.g. Heroku.)                                            *
   *                                                                         *

   * The runtime "environment" of your Sails app is usually either           *
   * 'development' or 'production'.                                          *
   *                                                                         *
   * In development, your Sails app will go out of its way to help you       *
   * (for instance you will receive more descriptive error and               *
   * debugging output)                                                       *

   * In production, Sails configures itself (and its dependencies) to        *
   * optimize performance. You should always put your app in production mode *
   * before you deploy it to a server.  This helps ensure that your Sails    *
   * app remains stable, performant, and scalable.                           *
   *                                                                         *
   * By default, Sails sets its environment using the `NODE_ENV` environment *
   * variable.  If NODE_ENV is not set, Sails will run in the                *
   * 'development' environment.                                              *
   *                                                                         *
